#DealorNoDeal
Final project for my first semester of computer engineering.
This is my version of Deal or no Deal made entirely in C and standard libraries.
This project was made to use all the basic C programming concepts: Variables, Loops, Control statements, Arrays, Functions, Structures, File handling and dynamic memory allocations.
